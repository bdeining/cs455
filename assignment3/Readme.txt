Question 9 :

    On a per state basis, analyze what percentage of the population lives in a rural environment vs
    an urban one.  This demographic shows which states have a predominantly rural population, and may
    show correlations between other demographics on the state as a whole (religious, political, housing values).
    This data was plotted in plot.ly and can be found here : https://plot.ly/~bdeininger/6/rural-population/.
    From analysis, the state with the highest urban population was Pennsylvania.
